## Monolithic Vendor Lock-in vs. Lightweight Portability

Firebase requires proprietary SDKs, complex client-side bundle bloat, and rigid NoSQL querying limits. It provides a robust ecosystem for massive scale, but that ecosystem is architectural overhead during the phase where you are still proving the product.

## Why Developers Choose Stubbase for Prototypes

Stubbase provides a lightweight, SDK-free REST alternative, delivering raw endpoints over standard HTTP.

- **SDK-Free Execution:** Firebase requires installing large Node modules or Web SDKs. Stubbase relies purely on standard `fetch()` and HTTP protocols.
- **Relational Routing:** Firestore requires multiple asynchronous network calls or complex aggregations to join collections. Stubbase supports native relational joins using standard URL parameters: `?_expand=...`.
- **Infrastructure Overhead:** Firebase staging environments incur baseline costs and data-read fees. Stubbase lets dormant projects sit at $0 and wakes them instantly on the first request.
- **Data Portability:** Exporting Firebase NoSQL trees requires CLI tools and parsing. Stubbase stores your entire database as a standard, flat JSON file, ready to be migrated to Postgres or MongoDB whenever you outgrow the platform.
